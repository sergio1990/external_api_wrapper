I like to practive the approach to wrap the 3rd-party API usages. In most cases, to call some API the steps are pretty the same:

- build a full URI to the desired endpoint
- extend the URI by the query parameters
- do a HTTP request
- parse the response and provide it to the client code

When you work only with the one 3rd party service it okay, but after adding more and more external services to work with the process to create the wrappers becomes boring and contains repetitive steps with a lot of simple copy-paste actions.
The decision to extract some abstraction should be very deliberated, but I've decided to make the one to more easily create 3rd-party API wrappers.

There are a lot of cases, which aren't covered by this library and based on only on the needs of the projects on which I work, but all suggestions and PRs are welcome üòè

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'external_api_wrapper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install external_api_wrapper

## Usage

To use this library a plenty steps should be passed, but they are pretty simple and straightforward, I hope üòã I am going to describe all of them in an order below.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Style Checking

To be consistent around the code and its style the RuboCop is used. To run it on your local machine, please, type `rake rubocop` rake task and observe the opened page in the browser with the results.

In the repo root folder you can find the `.rubocop.yml` file, which overwrites the RuboCop default config. Those adjustments are based on my personal preferences and, of course, could be doubted :smile:
